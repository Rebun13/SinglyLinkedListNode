# SinglyLinkedListNode

## Description

Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to insert at a certain position, create a new node with the given integer as its _data_ attribute, insert this node at the desired position and return the head node.
A position of 0 indicates the head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty. 

## Returns

-  SinglyLinkedListNode pointer: a reference to the head of the revised list

## Input

- The first line contains an integer _n_, the number of elements in the linked list.
- Each of the next _n_ lines contains an integer SinglyLinkedListNode[i].data.
- The next line contains an integer _data_, the data of the node that is to be inserted.
- The last line contains an integer _position_.
